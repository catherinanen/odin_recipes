            <h2>How to do it?</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>If we have a whole chicken, it should be cut into parts - cut off the neck, wings, thighs. Leave the body together with the breasts. </li>
                <li>Rinse all parts of chicken and beef and offal, then put in a large pot and pour cold water. Salt and boil over medium heat.</li>
                <li>After boiling, reduce the fire and hum the decoction. Reduce the heat and cook over low heat (the broth is only supposed to "blink") under a slightly ajar lid for about 1 and 1/2 hours.</li>
                <li>In the meantime, prepare vegetables: peel carrots, parsley and celery (or for a larger aroma - just wash thoroughly). Rinse the onion, leek and parsley (do not peel the onion, its husks will give the soup a nice color).</li>
                <li>Put the vegetables in the broth and boil. Add spices: allspice, bay leaf and black pepper. Reduce the heat and cook over low heat for about 1 hour or up to 1 and 1/2 hour.</li>
                <li>Serve the broth hot, with cooked pasta, chopped parsley, thinly sliced carrots from the broth and pieces of chicken meat.</li>
            </ol>
